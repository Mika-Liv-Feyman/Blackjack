This is a rudimentary Blackjack app in java. It is crashproof and allows for user input. 

ok so you wanna add more files

so if you make a new directory you have to clone it

so go on the website of the repository and just copy the link in the "Clone" tab

then in terminal, navigate to the directory using cd and dir, then do:

git clone https://insertlinkhere.com/

then add the files you want into the new directory that is created in your filesystem using Windows and do:

git add filename.ext <-- this is to add an individual file. to add all files in a dir, do

git add .

then do: 

git commit -m "commit message"

then do:

git commit origin master

and then check github!
